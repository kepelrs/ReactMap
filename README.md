# Udacity's Nanodegree MyCities Project (React)

This project is part of the Udacity's Nanodegree Course and there was no starter code provided. My job was to build everything from scratch using React and at least two external API's: one for maps and one of my choice.

This app can be used to keep up to date with the news and other published content related to the cities where your friends and family live. The content is sourced from over 30,000 sources and is sorted by relevance.

## API's used
This project makes use of the [GoogleMapsAPI](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) and [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org). The React app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Dependecies
I kept the dependencies of the project to a minimum. Other than bootstrapping the project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), the only extra dependency added is ['escape-string-regexp'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/escape-regex-string). All the API handling function/classes were created manually and passed over for React to manage.
